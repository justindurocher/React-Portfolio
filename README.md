<h1>Installation</h1>
    
<p>With creating this application, I used npx create-react-app and finished downloading all of the left out dependencies. Using react-bootstrap I was able to create all of the front-end pages needed. A home page, projects, and contact page are created, as well as a seperate tab with a relative path to my resume. For the backend, I used javascript as well as react-animations to add different effects to all the components on the page. After creating the application, I used Heroku to host and serve the page to the internet.</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<p>The purpose of this application is for users who want to check either what the current weather is of a certain city, or check up on the five day forecast is predicted to be. There is a search bar located in the top left corner where the user can search up as many as 10 cities that will keep popping up as blocks under the search bar. Once the user clicks on one of those blocks, the weather data will be displayed on the dashboard to the right.</p>
